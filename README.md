# NitSpec

NitSpec is gun shooting augmentation project which main goal is to calculate projectile path to target. 
It consists multiple sensors like angle, range and air pressure. See <b>[promo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK83oCnupcM)</b>.

I brought this project on Github so other people can implement it for their own use. I take absolutely
no responsibility of use of this app implementation or it's implementation target. 
I have mainly meant it for air rifles.

NitSpec project failed because of lack of funding but it would still be fun project to develop.

App is available for Android here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitramite.nitspec](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitramite.nitspec)

4. You need physical phone since Bluetooth connection.

###### Arduino
1. Cheap inexpensive Atmega328 based processor will do. (Arduino Nano)
2. Go to `/Arduino` directory where you find schematics for Arduino device and `.ino` file for source code.
3. Burn source code into Arduino device.

###### Hardware
1. `/3D Models` folder has some example parts for trigger mechanism. Use your own imagination related to
target hardware to create basic trigger servo pulling mechanism.
2. More documentation of mechanism here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISyNdOlAn08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISyNdOlAn08)
